# OpenGl-Aquarium
This program presents a model aquarium created in OpenGL to demonstrate features such as per-vertex lighting, keyframe animation, display lists and transparency. A focal point is the rolling waves at the top of the aquarium which loop seemlessly. This program must be run in Visual Studio 2022 for Windows.
